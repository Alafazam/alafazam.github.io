The second generation t413.com. Built 2010-2012. Made full use of html5 push/pop-state for a dynamic preloaded javascript experience with static fallback. Dynamic and interactive charts and plots of photo EXIF data to interact with over 30,000 images in real-time. Self designed, developed, and hosted.
