My web site, t413.com, has been down for 6 months. It's time I fixed it.

####What happened?

My server was a intel atom nettop running behind someone's desk back in North Carolina.

They got a new desk.

My site went down.

My server disappeared.

####Why was I running my site like that?

Lots of reasons. I was hosting several hundred gigabytes of photos which would have been
prohibitively expensive to host anywhere else. Running my own server was a great
teaching tool and challenge when I was in middle school and I kept the habit
all through college and beyond.

Now-adays I don't want to pay for rack space for a personal gallery and deal with
the very very real problem of security on my own box. Github pages to the rescue!

####Where's the gallery?

Yeah yeah. There were tens of thousands of priceless images, carefully curated,
that told the story of my middle school, high school and college life. They
showed the world around me and highlighted communities I think are great. I put
years of work into developing the style, technology, and photography that went
into it.

Don't worry, I've got a few backups. I'll do something with them.

####What's next?

Dunno. Haven't written that far ye
