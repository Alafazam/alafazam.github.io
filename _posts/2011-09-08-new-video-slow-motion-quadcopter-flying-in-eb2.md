This was taken on my friend Hardik's Canon 60D.Â Music is from the band State Radio and the song: Wicker Plane.

I used ffmpeg extensively to get the 60fps video to slow-mo 30fps, then ffmpeg again to extract the audio to wav, then Sound Studio (mac app) to resample the audio to the same speed as the video. Next I used Sound Studio to splice, in rythem, the intro, solo, and final few seconds of 'Wicker Plane' together, then mix it together with the slow-mo sound of my quad and just imovie to put together the timeline of video.
