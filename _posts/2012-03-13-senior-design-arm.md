Ever wanted a high-strength robotic arm that's made entirely of 3D prtinted and laser-cut parts and off-the-shelf compodents and electronics? I have, and that's why I'm building it with my group of 4.

I put together a [google site page](https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/robot-manipulator-arm/home) to keep track of the project's status and eventually host tutorials, APIs, and other documents you'll need to build your own! Check it out.
