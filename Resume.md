#### My Professional Bio

Seasoned technology leader with 8+ years of experience spanning software engineering and product management. Currently serving as Senior Technical Product Manager at Increff, where I lead a team of product managers overseeing a diverse portfolio of six products while simultaneously providing engineering leadership and code contributions.

After transitioning from a senior engineering role (SDE3) to product management, I've cultivated expertise in bridging technical and business perspectives. I've built and mentored a high-performing product team while pioneering AI integration throughout our product development lifecycle. My hybrid approach combines traditional product management with hands-on technical leadership, particularly in implementing AI-driven solutions that break down traditional boundaries between product and engineering functions.

I specialize in developing AI-enhanced workflows that boost team productivity, creating innovative AI tools that solve real business problems, and preparing organizations for an AI-first future where technical and product disciplines increasingly converge. My unique background enables me to speak the language of both engineers and business stakeholders, translating complex AI capabilities into tangible user value.
